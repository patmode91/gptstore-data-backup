>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
Your task is to talk to a new client and develop a detailed specification for a new application the client wants to build. This specification will serve as an input to an AI software developer and thus must be very detailed, contain all the project functionality and precisely define behaviour, 3rd-party integrations (if any), etc.

The AI developer prefers working on web apps using Node/Express/MongoDB/Mongoose/EJS stack, and use vanilla JS with Bootstrap on the frontend, unless the client has different requirements.
Try to avoid the use of Docker, Kubernetes, microservices and single-page app frameworks like React, Next.js, Angular, Vue or Svelte unless the brief explicitly requires it.

In your work, follow these important rules:
* In your communication with the client, be straightforward, concise, and focused on the task.
* Ask questions ONE BY ONE. This is veryy important, as the client is easily confused. If you were to ask multiple questions the user would probably miss some questions, so remember to always ask the questions one by one
* Ask specific questions, taking into account what you already know about the project. For example, don't ask "what features do you need?" or "describe your idea"; instead ask "what is the most important feature?"
* Pay special attention to any documentation or information that the project might require (such as accessing a custom API, etc). Be sure to ask the user to provide information and examples that the developers will need to build the proof-of-concept. You will need to output all of this in the final specification.
* This is a a prototype project, it is important to have small and well-defined scope. If the scope seems to grow too large (beyond a week or two of work for one developer), ask the user if they can simplify the project.
* Do not address non-functional requirements (performance, deployment, security, budget, timelines, etc...). We are only concerned with functional and technical specification here.
* Do not address deployment or hosting, including DevOps tasks to set up a CI/CD pipeline
* Don't address or invision any future development (post proof-of-concept), the scope of your task is to only spec the PoC/prototype.
* If the user provided specific information on how to access 3rd party API or how exactly to implement something, you MUST include that in the specification. Remember, the AI developer will only have access to the specification you write.

Ensure that you have all the information about:
* overall description and goals for the app
* all the features of the application
* functional specification
    * how the user will use the app
    * enumerate all the parts of the application (eg. pages of the application, background processing if any, etc); for each part, explain *in detail* how it should work from the perspective of the user
    * identify any constraints, business rules, user flows or other important info that affect how the application works or how it is used
* technical specification
    * what kind of an application this is and what platform/technologies will be used
    * the architecture of the application (what happens on backend, frontend, mobile, background tasks, integration with 3rd party services, etc)
    * detailed description of each component of the application architecture
* integration specification
    * any 3rd party apps, services, APIs that will be used (eg. for auth, payments, etc..)
    * if a custom API is used, precise definitions, with examples, how to use the custom API or do the custom integration

If you identify any missing information or need clarification on any vague or ambiguous parts of the brief, ask the client about it.

Important note: don't ask trivial questions for obvious or unimportant parts of the app, for example:
* Bad questions example 1:
  * Client brief: I want to build a hello world web app
  * Bad questions:
    * What title do you want for the web page that displays "Hello World"?
    * What color and font size would you like for the "Hello World" text to be displayed in?
    * Should the "Hello World" message be static text served directly from the server, or would you like it implemented via JavaScript on the client side?
  * Explanation: There's no need to micromanage the developer(s) and designer(s), the client would've specified these details if they were important.

If you ask such trivial questions, the client will think you're stupid and will leave. DOn'T DO THAT

Think carefully about what a developer must know to be able to build the app. The specification must address all of this information, otherwise the AI software developer will not be able to build the app.

When you gather all the information from the client, output the complete specification. Remember, the specification should define both functional aspects (features - what it does, what the user should be able to do), the technical details (architecture, technologies preferred by the user, etc), and the integration details (pay special attention to describe these in detail). Include all important features and clearly describe how each feature should function. IMPORTANT: Do not add any preamble (eg. "Here's the specification....") or conclusion/commentary (eg. "Let me know if you have further questions")!

Here's an EXAMPLE initial prompt:
---start-of-example-output---
Online forum similar to Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com), with a simple and clean interface, where people can post links or text posts, and other people can upvote, downvote and comment on. Reading is open to anonymous users, but users must register to post, upvote, downvote or comment. Use simple username+password authentication. The forum should be implemented in Node.js with Express framework, using MongoDB and Mongoose ORM.

The UI should use EJS view engine, Bootstrap for styling and plain vanilla JavaScript. Design should be simple and look like Hacker News, with a top bar for navigation, using a blue color scheme instead of the orange color in HN. The footer in each page should just be "Built using GPT Pilot".

Each story has a title (one-line text), a link (optional, URL to an external article being shared on AI News), and text (text to show in the post). Link and text are mutually exclusive - if the submitter tries to use both, show them an error.

Use the following algorithm to rank top stories, and comments within a story: "score = upvotes - downvotes + comments - sqrt(age)" , where "upvotes" and "downvotes" are the number of upvotes and downvotes the story or comment has, "comments" is the number of comments for a story (total), or the number of sub-comments (for a comment), and "age" is how old is the story, in minutes, and "sqrt" is the square root function.

Implement the following pages:

* / - shows the top 20 posted stories, ranked using the scoring algorithm, with a "More" link that shows the next 20 (pagination using "p" query parameter), and so on
* /newest - shows the latest 20 posted stories, ranked chronologically (newest first), with a "More" link that shows the next 20 (pagination using "p" query parameter), and so on
* /submit - shows a form to submit a new story, upon submitting the user should get redirected to /newest
* /login - shows a login form (username, password, "login" button, and a link to register page for new users)
* /register - shows a register form (username, password, "register" button, and a link to login page for existing users)
* /item - shows the story (use "id" query parameter to pass the story ID to this route)
* /comment - shows the form to send a comment  (just a textarea and "submit" button) - upon commenting, the person should get redirected to the story they commented on

The / and /newest pages should show the story title (link to the external article if "link" is set, otherwise link to the story item /item page), number of points (points = upvotes - downvotes), poster username (no link), how old is the story ("x minutes ago", "y hours ago" or "z days ago"), and "xyz comments" (link to /item page of the story). This is basically the same how HN shows it.

The /item page should also follow the layout for HN in how it shows the story, and the comments tree. Instead of the embedded "reply" form, the story should just have a "comment" button that goes to the /comment page, similar to the "reply" link underneath each comment. Both should link to the /comment page.
---end-of-example-output---

Remember, this is important: the AI developer will not have access to client's initial description and transcript of your conversation. The developer will only see the specification you output on the end. It is very important that the spec captures *all* the details of the project in as much detail and precision as possible.

Note: after the client reads the specification you create, the client might have additional comments or suggestions. In this case, continue the discussion with the user until you get all the new information and output the newly updated spec again.

#### Overall Description and Goals
The application aims to provide real-time reviews, insights, and comparisons for custom GPT models available on the GPT store platform. It will facilitate users in making informed decisions by providing valuable data about each GPT model, including ratings, use cases, and user experiences. The app will also enable users to create profiles, submit their reviews, and interact with the community through discussions.

#### Features of the Application
1. **User Authentication**: Users must register and create a profile to access the app's features. The authentication system will support sign-up, login, and user profile management.
2. **Real-time GPT Reviews Generation**: Upon user request, the app will generate real-time reviews for GPT models, including a name, image (logo/favicon), 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data.
3. **GPT Comparison**: Users will be able to compare GPT models side by side based on their reviews, ratings, and use cases.
4. **User Reviews Submission**: Registered users can submit their reviews for GPT models.
5. **Community Discussion Platform**: A section for users to chat, share experiences, request feedback on custom GPT models, and receive feedback.

#### Functional Specification
1. **User Registration/Login**: A registration form for new users (username, password, email) and a login form for returning users. Passwords should be securely hashed.
2. **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit their profiles, including username, email, and password.
3. **Review Generation Page**: A search interface where users can request reviews for specific GPT models. The page will display generated reviews, including GPT model names, images, ratings, and detailed insights.
4. **Comparison Feature**: A comparison tool allowing users to select and compare multiple GPT models side by side.
5. **Submit Review Form**: A form for users to submit their reviews, including a rating and text description.
6. **Community Discussion Area**: A forum-like section for user discussions, feedback requests, and sharing experiences.

#### Technical Specification
- **Platform/Technologies**: Node.js with Express framework, MongoDB for database, Mongoose ORM for database management. React (or a similar JavaScript framework/library) for the frontend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and interaction.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Backend**: Express.js application handling API requests for user authentication, review generation, comparison data processing, and community interactions. MongoDB used for storing user data, reviews, and discussion content.
  - **Frontend**: React-based SPA (Single Page Application) for a dynamic user experience, including forms for registration/login, review submission, and a comparison tool interface. EJS could be used for server-side rendering of pages if React is not chosen.
  - **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with the GPT store platform's API to retrieve information and reviews on GPT models. Custom APIs for real-time review generation and data retrieval.

#### Integration Specification
- **GPT Store Platform API**: Integrate with the GPT store's API to fetch GPT model data, including names, images, and available insights. Precise authentication and data request methods should be based on the GPT store's API documentation.
- **User Authentication API**: For registering and authenticating users, possibly leveraging OAuth or JWT for secure session management.

### Constraints and Other Important Information
- **User Flow**: The app should ensure a smooth user flow from registration, through review generation, to comparison and community interaction, with minimal steps required to accomplish each task.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data and reviews are securely stored and managed, complying with privacy regulations.
- **Scalability**: While this is a prototype, the design should consider scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation feature.

You're designing the architecture and technical specifications for a new project.

If the project requirements call out for specific technology, use that. Otherwise, if working on a web app, prefer Node.js for the backend (with Express if a web server is needed, and MongoDB if a database is needed), and Bootstrap for the front-end. You MUST NOT use Docker, Kubernetes, microservices and single-page app frameworks like React, Next.js, Angular, Vue or Svelte unless the project details explicitly require it.

Here are the details for the new project:

-----------------------------

Based on these details, think step by step to design the architecture for the project and choose technologies to use in building it.

1. First, design and describe project architecture in general terms
2. Then, list any system dependencies that should be installed on the system prior to start of development.  For each system depedency, output a Windows command to check whether it's installed.
3. Finally, list any other 3rd party packages or libraries that will be used (that will be installed later using packager a package manager in the project repository/environment).
4. Optionally, choose a project starter template.

You have an option to use a project template that implements standard boilerplate/scaffolding so you can start faster and be more productive. To be considered, a template must be compatible with the architecture and technologies you've choosen (it doesn't need to implement everything that will be used in the project, just a useful subset). If multiple templates can be considered, pick one that's the best match.

If no project templates are a good match, don't pick any! It's better to start from scratch than to use a template that is not a good fit for the project and then spend time reworking it to fit the requirements.

Here are the available project templates:

### node_express_mongoose
Node + Express + MongoDB web app with session-based authentication, EJS views and Bootstrap 5

Contains:
* initial Node + Express setup
* User model in Mongoose ORM with username and password fields, ensuring username is unique and hashing passwords with bcrypt prior to saving to the database
* session-based authentication using username + password (hashed using bcrypt) in routes/authRoutes.js, using express-session
* authentication middleware to protect routes that require login
* EJS view engine, html head, header and footer EJS partials, with included Boostrap 5.x CSS and JS
* routes and EJS views for login, register, and home (main) page
* config loading from environment using dotenv with a placeholder .env.example file: you will need to create a .env file with your own values


*IMPORTANT*: You must follow these rules while creating your project:

* You must only list *system* dependencies, ie. the ones that need to be installed (typically as admin) to set up the programming language, database, etc. Any packages that will need to be installed via language/platform-specific package managers are *not* system dependencies.
* If there are several popular options (such as Nginx or Apache for web server), pick one that would be more suitable for the app in question.
* DO NOT include text editors, IDEs, shells, OpenSSL, CLI tools such as git, AWS, or Stripe clients, or other utilities in your list. only direct dependencies required to build and run the project.
* If a dependency (such as database) has a cloud alternative or can be installed on another computer (ie. isn't required on this computer), you must mark it as `required_locally: false`

I ran the command `mongosh --version`. The output was:

stderr:
```
'mongosh' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

```
stdout:
```

```

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.

You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling you that you're assigned to work on a new project. You are working on a App called "GPT-CRITIK" and you need to create a detailed development plan so that developers can start developing the app.

Here is a high level description of "GPT-CRITIK":
```
### Application Specification for GPT Review and Comparison Web App

#### Overall Description and Goals
The application aims to provide real-time reviews, insights, and comparisons for custom GPT models available on the GPT store platform. It will facilitate users in making informed decisions by providing valuable data about each GPT model, including ratings, use cases, and user experiences. The app will also enable users to create profiles, submit their reviews, and interact with the community through discussions.

#### Features of the Application
1. **User Authentication**: Users must register and create a profile to access the app's features. The authentication system will support sign-up, login, and user profile management.
2. **Real-time GPT Reviews Generation**: Upon user request, the app will generate real-time reviews for GPT models, including a name, image (logo/favicon), 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data.
3. **GPT Comparison**: Users will be able to compare GPT models side by side based on their reviews, ratings, and use cases.
4. **User Reviews Submission**: Registered users can submit their reviews for GPT models.
5. **Community Discussion Platform**: A section for users to chat, share experiences, request feedback on custom GPT models, and receive feedback.

#### Functional Specification
1. **User Registration/Login**: A registration form for new users (username, password, email) and a login form for returning users. Passwords should be securely hashed.
2. **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit their profiles, including username, email, and password.
3. **Review Generation Page**: A search interface where users can request reviews for specific GPT models. The page will display generated reviews, including GPT model names, images, ratings, and detailed insights.
4. **Comparison Feature**: A comparison tool allowing users to select and compare multiple GPT models side by side.
5. **Submit Review Form**: A form for users to submit their reviews, including a rating and text description.
6. **Community Discussion Area**: A forum-like section for user discussions, feedback requests, and sharing experiences.

#### Technical Specification
- **Platform/Technologies**: Node.js with Express framework, MongoDB for database, Mongoose ORM for database management. React (or a similar JavaScript framework/library) for the frontend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and interaction.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Backend**: Express.js application handling API requests for user authentication, review generation, comparison data processing, and community interactions. MongoDB used for storing user data, reviews, and discussion content.
  - **Frontend**: React-based SPA (Single Page Application) for a dynamic user experience, including forms for registration/login, review submission, and a comparison tool interface. EJS could be used for server-side rendering of pages if React is not chosen.
  - **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with the GPT store platform's API to retrieve information and reviews on GPT models. Custom APIs for real-time review generation and data retrieval.

#### Integration Specification
- **GPT Store Platform API**: Integrate with the GPT store's API to fetch GPT model data, including names, images, and available insights. Precise authentication and data request methods should be based on the GPT store's API documentation.
- **User Authentication API**: For registering and authenticating users, possibly leveraging OAuth or JWT for secure session management.

### Constraints and Other Important Information
- **User Flow**: The app should ensure a smooth user flow from registration, through review generation, to comparison and community interaction, with minimal steps required to accomplish each task.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data and reviews are securely stored and managed, complying with privacy regulations.
- **Scalability**: While this is a prototype, the design should consider scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation feature.
Additional info/examples:
- Utilize possible React or something similar that works well with JavaScript for the frontend development.
- The real-time reviews generated should contain any other valuable and resourceful data that can be retrieved to help the users understand and determine the right pick for their use case.
- Users should also have a way for them to request for others to try a custom GPT that they have created and be able to receive feedback and so on.
```

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The GPT-CRITIK app utilizes a client-server architecture with React for the frontend to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience, and Node.js with Express for the backend to handle API requests, user authentication, and data processing. MongoDB, accessed through Mongoose, serves as the database to store user profiles, reviews, and discussion content. The app integrates with the GPT store platform's API for real-time data on GPT models. The architecture emphasizes scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building the backend part of the app.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database to store user profiles, reviews, and discussions. Can be used via cloud services like MongoDB Atlas if preferred.
* express - Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and routing.
* mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
* react - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* bcrypt - A library to help you hash passwords.
* jsonwebtoken - Implementation of JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
* axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used for API calls.
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env.



The developers have already used a project scaffolding tool that creates the initial boilerplate for the project:
The code so far includes:
* initial Node + Express setup
* User model in Mongoose ORM with username and password fields, ensuring username is unique and hashing passwords with bcrypt prior to saving to the database
* session-based authentication using username + password (hashed using bcrypt) in routes/authRoutes.js, using express-session
* authentication middleware to protect routes that require login
* EJS view engine, html head, header and footer EJS partials, with included Boostrap 5.x CSS and JS
* routes and EJS views for login, register, and home (main) page
* config loading from environment using dotenv with a placeholder .env.example file: you will need to create a .env file with your own values

Here are files that are currently implemented:

Before we go into the coding part, I want you to split the development process of creating this app into smaller tasks so that it is easier to develop, debug and make the app work.

Each task needs to be related only to the development of this app and nothing else - once the app is fully working, that is it. There shouldn't be a task for researching, deployment, writing documentation, testing or anything that is not writing the actual code.

**IMPORTANT**
As an experienced tech lead you always follow rules on how to create tasks. Dividing project into tasks is extremely important job and you have to do it very carefully.

Now, based on the project details provided, think task by task and create the entire development plan. Continue from the existing code listed above and specify each task until the moment when the entire app should be fully working. You should not reimplement what's already done - just continue from the implementation already there while strictly following these rules:

Rule #1
There should never be a task that is only testing or ensuring something works, every task must have coding involved. Have this in mind for every task, but it is extremely important for last task of project. Testing if app works will be done as part of each task.

Rule #2
This rule applies to the complexity of tasks.
You have to make sure the project is not split into tasks that are too small or simple for no reason but also not too big or complex so that they are hard to develop, debug and review.
Have in mind that project already has workspace folder created and only system dependencies installed. You don't have to create tasks for that.
Here are examples of poorly created tasks:

**too simple tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project and install all necessary dependencies.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection using Mongoose with the IP '127.0.0.1'.

**too complex tasks**
- Set up Node.js project with /home, /profile, /register and /login routes that will have user authentication, connection to MongoDB with user schemas, mailing of new users and frontend with nice design.

You must to avoid creating tasks that are too simple or too complex. You have to aim to create tasks that are medium complexity. Here are examples of tasks that are good:

**good tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project, install all necessary dependencies and set up an express server with a simple route to `/ping` that returns the status 200.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection and implement the message schema using Mongoose for persistent storage of messages.

Rule #3
This rule applies to the number of tasks you will create.
Every app should have different number of tasks depending on complexity. Think task by task and create the minimum number of tasks that are relevant for this specific app. Here are some examples of apps with different complexity that can give you guidance on how many tasks you should create:

Example #1:
app description: "I want to create an app that will just say 'Hello World' when I open it on my localhost:3000."
number of tasks: 1-2

Example #2:
app description: "Create a node.js app that enables users to register and log into the app. On frontend it should have /home (shows user data), /register and /login. It should use sessions to keep user logged in."
number of tasks: 2-4

Example #3:
app description: "A cool online shoe store, with a sleek look. In terms of data models, there are shoes, categories and user profiles. For web pages: product listing, details, shopping cart. It must look cool and jazzy."
number of tasks: 5-15

Rule #4
This rule applies to writing task 'description'.
Every task must have a clear and very detailed (must be minimum of 4 sentences but can be more) 'description'. It must be very clear so that even developers who just moved to this project can execute them without additional questions. It is not enough to just write something like "Create a route for /home". You have to describe what needs to be done in that route, what data needs to be returned, what should be the status code, etc. Give as many details as possible and make sure no information is missing that could be needed for this task.
Here is an example of good and bad task description:

**bad task**
{
    "description": "Create a route for /dashboard"
}

**good task**
{
    "description": "In 'route.js' add a route for /dashboard that returns the status 200. Route should be accessible only for logged in users. In 'middlewares.js' there should be a check if user is logged in using session. If user is not logged in, it should redirect to /login. If user is logged in, it should return the user data. User data should be fetched from database in 'users' collection using the user id from session."
}

Rule #5

Here is a high level description of "GPT-CRITIK":
```
### Application Specification for GPT Review and Comparison Web App

#### Overall Description and Goals
The application aims to provide real-time reviews, insights, and comparisons for custom GPT models available on the GPT store platform. It will facilitate users in making informed decisions by providing valuable data about each GPT model, including ratings, use cases, and user experiences. The app will also enable users to create profiles, submit their reviews, and interact with the community through discussions.

#### Features of the Application
1. **User Authentication**: Users must register and create a profile to access the app's features. The authentication system will support sign-up, login, and user profile management.
2. **Real-time GPT Reviews Generation**: Upon user request, the app will generate real-time reviews for GPT models, including a name, image (logo/favicon), 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data.
3. **GPT Comparison**: Users will be able to compare GPT models side by side based on their reviews, ratings, and use cases.
4. **User Reviews Submission**: Registered users can submit their reviews for GPT models.
5. **Community Discussion Platform**: A section for users to chat, share experiences, request feedback on custom GPT models, and receive feedback.

#### Functional Specification
1. **User Registration/Login**: A registration form for new users (username, password, email) and a login form for returning users. Passwords should be securely hashed.
2. **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit their profiles, including username, email, and password.
3. **Review Generation Page**: A search interface where users can request reviews for specific GPT models. The page will display generated reviews, including GPT model names, images, ratings, and detailed insights.
4. **Comparison Feature**: A comparison tool allowing users to select and compare multiple GPT models side by side.
5. **Submit Review Form**: A form for users to submit their reviews, including a rating and text description.
6. **Community Discussion Area**: A forum-like section for user discussions, feedback requests, and sharing experiences.

#### Technical Specification
- **Platform/Technologies**: Node.js with Express framework, MongoDB for database, Mongoose ORM for database management. React (or a similar JavaScript framework/library) for the frontend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and interaction.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Backend**: Express.js application handling API requests for user authentication, review generation, comparison data processing, and community interactions. MongoDB used for storing user data, reviews, and discussion content.
  - **Frontend**: React-based SPA (Single Page Application) for a dynamic user experience, including forms for registration/login, review submission, and a comparison tool interface. EJS could be used for server-side rendering of pages if React is not chosen.
  - **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with the GPT store platform's API to retrieve information and reviews on GPT models. Custom APIs for real-time review generation and data retrieval.

#### Integration Specification
- **GPT Store Platform API**: Integrate with the GPT store's API to fetch GPT model data, including names, images, and available insights. Precise authentication and data request methods should be based on the GPT store's API documentation.
- **User Authentication API**: For registering and authenticating users, possibly leveraging OAuth or JWT for secure session management.

### Constraints and Other Important Information
- **User Flow**: The app should ensure a smooth user flow from registration, through review generation, to comparison and community interaction, with minimal steps required to accomplish each task.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data and reviews are securely stored and managed, complying with privacy regulations.
- **Scalability**: While this is a prototype, the design should consider scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation feature.

- Utilize possible React or something similar that works well with JavaScript for the frontend development.
- The real-time reviews generated should contain any other valuable and resourceful data that can be retrieved to help the users understand and determine the right pick for their use case.
- Users should also have a way for them to request for others to try a custom GPT that they have created and be able to receive feedback and so on.
```

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The GPT-CRITIK app utilizes a client-server architecture with React for the frontend to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience, and Node.js with Express for the backend to handle API requests, user authentication, and data processing. MongoDB, accessed through Mongoose, serves as the database to store user profiles, reviews, and discussion content. The app integrates with the GPT store platform's API for real-time data on GPT models. The architecture emphasizes scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building the backend part of the app.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database to store user profiles, reviews, and discussions. Can be used via cloud services like MongoDB Atlas if preferred.
* express - Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and routing.
* mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
* react - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* bcrypt - A library to help you hash passwords.
* jsonwebtoken - Implementation of JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
* axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used for API calls.
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env.



Here are files that are currently implemented:

---END_OF_FILES---


We've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:
```
1. Implement the GPT Model Review Generation feature. Create a new route in Express (e.g., /api/reviews/generate) that accepts POST requests. This route will call the GPT store platform's API to fetch the latest reviews for a specific GPT model based on the model ID provided in the request body. Use axios for making the API call. The response from the GPT store's API should be processed to include the GPT model's name, image, 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data before sending it back to the client. Ensure error handling for the API call and send appropriate responses for success and failure scenarios.

2. Develop the GPT Comparison feature. This involves creating a new route (e.g., /api/comparison) that supports POST requests, where users can submit two or more GPT model IDs for comparison. The backend will fetch data for each GPT model through the GPT store platform's API using axios, compare them based on ratings, reviews, and use cases, and return the comparison result to the client. Implement logic to handle cases where data for one or more models could not be retrieved and ensure the frontend receives a comprehensive comparison result or an error message.

3. Create a User Review Submission functionality. Add a new route (e.g., /api/reviews/submit) that handles POST requests for submitting user reviews. This route will require authentication, so integrate the existing authentication middleware to verify the user's session. The request body should include the GPT model ID, user rating, and text description. Store the review in MongoDB with a structure that links it to both the user and the GPT model. Implement input validation to ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted before saving the review.

4. Implement the Community Discussion Platform. Create a new MongoDB schema for discussion posts, including fields for the user ID (author), post content, timestamps, and replies (embedded documents or references to other documents). Develop routes for creating a new discussion post (/api/discussion/new), fetching all posts (/api/discussion), and replying to a post (/api/discussion/reply). Ensure that creating posts and replying require user authentication. Use Express to handle these routes, implementing appropriate request validation and error handling.

5. Set up the frontend using React. Initialize a new React application within the project structure if not already done. Create components for the main areas of the application: Login/Register, User Profile Management, GPT Review Generation, GPT Comparison, User Review Submission, and Community Discussion. Use React Router for handling navigation between these components. Ensure that the user's authentication state controls access to components that require login, redirecting to the Login component if necessary.

6. Integrate the frontend with the backend. Utilize axios in the React components to make API calls to the backend routes for user registration/login, profile management, review generation, comparison, review submission, and accessing the community discussion platform. Implement state management to handle the data received from the API responses and update the UI accordingly. Include loading states and error handling in the UI to provide feedback to the user during API interactions.

7. Finalize the application styling and interactions. Use CSS and potentially a UI framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI to style the React components, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across the application. Add interactivity where necessary, such as form validation feedback, buttons for submitting forms, and toggles for comparison selections. Ensure that the application provides a smooth user experience, with clear navigational cues for accessing the various features of the application.

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.

**IMPORTANT**
Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written. When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved.

To implement the GPT Model Review Generation feature, follow these steps:

1. **Install Axios**: First, you need to install axios to make HTTP requests to the GPT store platform's API. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install axios
```

2. **Create a New Route for Review Generation**:
   - File: `routes/apiRoutes.js`
   - This file will contain the Express route to handle the review generation request. Add the following code to create a new route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/api/reviews/generate', async (req, res) => {
  const { modelId } = req.body; // Assuming modelId is passed in the request body

  if (!modelId) {
    return res.status(400).send('Model ID is required');
  }

  try {
    // Replace 'GPT_STORE_PLATFORM_API_URL' and 'API_KEY' with actual values
    const gptStoreResponse = await axios.get(`GPT_STORE_PLATFORM_API_URL/models/${modelId}?apiKey=API_KEY`);

    // Process the response to include only the required data
    const reviewData = {
      name: gptStoreResponse.data.name, // Assuming the response structure
      image: gptStoreResponse.data.image, // Assuming the response structure
      rating: gptStoreResponse.data.rating, // Assuming the response structure
      useCaseDescription: gptStoreResponse.data.useCaseDescription, // Assuming the response structure
      // Add any other valuable data processing here
    };

    res.json(reviewData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching GPT model data:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Failed to generate review due to an error');
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

3. **Update the Main Server File to Use apiRoutes**:
   - File: `server.js`
   - Import the `apiRoutes` module and use it with the Express app. Add the following lines to your `server.js` file:

```javascript
const apiRoutes = require('./routes/apiRoutes');

// Use apiRoutes with the Express app
app.use(apiRoutes);
```

This completes the implementation of the GPT Model Review Generation feature. You have created a new route that accepts POST requests to generate reviews for specific GPT models by fetching data from the GPT store platform's API and processing it before sending it back to the client.

To implement the GPT Model Review Generation feature, follow these steps:

1. **Install Axios**: First, you need to install axios to make HTTP requests to the GPT store platform's API. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install axios
```

2. **Create a New Route for Review Generation**:
   - File: `routes/apiRoutes.js`
   - This file will contain the Express route to handle the review generation request. Add the following code to create a new route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/api/reviews/generate', async (req, res) => {
  const { modelId } = req.body; // Assuming modelId is passed in the request body

  if (!modelId) {
    return res.status(400).send('Model ID is required');
  }

  try {
    // Replace 'GPT_STORE_PLATFORM_API_URL' and 'API_KEY' with actual values
    const gptStoreResponse = await axios.get(`GPT_STORE_PLATFORM_API_URL/models/${modelId}?apiKey=API_KEY`);

    // Process the response to include only the required data
    const reviewData = {
      name: gptStoreResponse.data.name, // Assuming the response structure
      image: gptStoreResponse.data.image, // Assuming the response structure
      rating: gptStoreResponse.data.rating, // Assuming the response structure
      useCaseDescription: gptStoreResponse.data.useCaseDescription, // Assuming the response structure
      // Add any other valuable data processing here
    };

    res.json(reviewData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching GPT model data:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Failed to generate review due to an error');
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

3. **Update the Main Server File to Use apiRoutes**:
   - File: `server.js`
   - Import the `apiRoutes` module and use it with the Express app. Add the following lines to your `server.js` file:

```javascript
const apiRoutes = require('./routes/apiRoutes');

// Use apiRoutes with the Express app
app.use(apiRoutes);
```

This completes the implementation of the GPT Model Review Generation feature. You have created a new route that accepts POST requests to generate reviews for specific GPT models by fetching data from the GPT store platform's API and processing it before sending it back to the client.

Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To implement the GPT Model` and ends with `it back to the client.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Windows machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

The current task has been split into multiple steps, and each step is one of the following:
* `command` - command to run
* `save_file` -  create or update a file
* `human_intervention` - if the human needs to do something


Here is the step you are currently debugging:
{'type': 'command', 'command': {'command': 'npm install axios', 'timeout': 60000}}

Here are steps that will be executed once debugging is done:
{'type': 'save_file', 'save_file': {'name': 'apiRoutes.js', 'path': '/routes/apiRoutes.js', 'code_change_description': '...'}}
{'type': 'save_file', 'save_file': {'name': 'server.js', 'path': '/server.js', 'code_change_description': '...'}}
When trying to see if command was ran successfully, take into consideration steps that were previously executed and steps that will be executed after the current step. It can happen that command seems like it failed but it will be fixed with next steps. In that case you should consider that command to be successfully executed.
I ran the command `npm install axios`. The output was:

stderr:
```
'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

```
stdout:
```

```

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.

The current task has been split into multiple steps, and each step is one of the following:
* `command` - command to run
* `save_file` -  create or update a file
* `human_intervention` - if the human needs to do something


Here is the step you are currently debugging:
{'type': 'command', 'command': {'command': 'npm install axios', 'timeout': 60000}}

Here are steps that will be executed once debugging is done:
{'type': 'save_file', 'save_file': {'name': 'apiRoutes.js', 'path': '/routes/apiRoutes.js', 'code_change_description': '...'}}
{'type': 'save_file', 'save_file': {'name': 'server.js', 'path': '/server.js', 'code_change_description': '...'}}

Now, we need to debug this issue and we need to be able to execute `npm install axios` successfully. .
I looked into this issue. I want you to take my findings as important part of debugging this issue. Here are my findings:
```
stderr:
```
'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

```
stdout:
```

```
```I want you to create a list of steps that are needed to debug this issue.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Windows machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `code_change` -  step will change the code and you need to thoroughly describe what needs to be implemented. I will implement the requested changes and let you know.
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

Also, make sure that at least the last step has `check_if_fixed` set to TRUE.

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

The current task has been split into multiple steps, and each step is one of the following:
* `command` - command to run
* `save_file` -  create or update a file
* `human_intervention` - if the human needs to do something


Here is the step you are currently debugging:
{'type': 'human_intervention', 'human_intervention_description': 'Please ensure Node.js is installed correctly on your system. You can verify this by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `node -v` to see if it returns a version number. If Node.js is not installed, please visit https://nodejs.org/ and download the latest version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.'}

Here are steps that will be executed once debugging is done:
{'type': 'command', 'command': {'command': 'npm install axios', 'timeout': 60000}, 'need_to_see_output': False, 'check_if_fixed': True}

You wanted me to check this - `Please ensure Node.js is installed correctly on your system. You can verify this by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `node -v` to see if it returns a version number. If Node.js is not installed, please visit https://nodejs.org/ and download the latest version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.` but there was a problem.
I looked into this issue. I want you to take my findings as important part of debugging this issue. Here are my findings:
```
generate useful and valuable, real time-reviews on custom GPT's and have a solid comparison system that the users can review 2 GPT's at the same time, side by side. Also to grow the app and site to monetize and scale it to a real business if possible.

```I want you to create a list of steps that are needed to debug this issue.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Windows machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `code_change` -  step will change the code and you need to thoroughly describe what needs to be implemented. I will implement the requested changes and let you know.
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

Also, make sure that at least the last step has `check_if_fixed` set to TRUE.

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

If there is no command to run reply with empty response.
For example, if we only setup package.json and no other files are coded there is no command to run so respond with `` without the `

I need to modify file `\routes\apiRoutes.js` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `\routes\apiRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `\server.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
// Load environment variables
require("dotenv").config();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');
const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL || !process.env.SESSION_SECRET) {
  console.error("Error: config environment variables not set. Please create/edit .env configuration file.");
  process.exit(-1);
}

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware to parse request bodies
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

// Setting the templating engine to EJS
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static("public"));

// Database connection
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connected successfully");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`Database connection error: ${err.message}`);
    console.error(err.stack);
    process.exit(1);
  });

// Session configuration with connect-mongo
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
  }),
);

app.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(`Server error: ${error.message}`);
  console.error(error.stack);
});

// Logging session creation and destruction
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const sess = req.session;
  // Make session available to all views
  res.locals.session = sess;
  if (!sess.views) {
    sess.views = 1;
    console.log("Session created at: ", new Date().toISOString());
  } else {
    sess.views++;
    console.log(
      `Session accessed again at: ${new Date().toISOString()}, Views: ${sess.views}, User ID: ${sess.userId || '(unauthenticated)'}`,
    );
  }
  next();
});

// Authentication Routes
app.use(authRoutes);

// Root path response
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index");
});

// If no routes handled the request, it's a 404
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.status(404).send("Page not found.");
});

// Error handling
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(`Unhandled application error: ${err.message}`);
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("There was an error serving your request.");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1

```


As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `\server.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted.

How can I run this app?
**IMPORTANT**
Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.
For example, if the command is "python app.py", then your response needs to be only `python app.py` without the `

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

If there is no command to run reply with empty response.
For example, if we only setup package.json and no other files are coded there is no command to run so respond with `` without the `

How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?

Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe what the expected response is.

**IMPORTANT**

Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:

1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don't want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just follow your instructions.
2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser. In case you can't do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command that the user can just run.
3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.
4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you're in the project directory")
5. The user is using Windows, so the commands must run on that operating system
6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don't ask user to install or run any software other than the app they're testing.
7. Don't ask the user to test things which aren't implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn't exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn't implemented yet)

Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!

Here is an example output with a few user steps:
---example---
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/
Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form

### Step 3
Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form
Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown
---end_of_example---

If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE

2024-03-14 18:55:45,579 [llm_connection.py:540 - stream_gpt_completion() ] INFO: <<<<<<<<<< LLM Response <<<<<<<<<<
### Step 1
Action: Start the server by running the command `npm start` in the terminal.
Expected result: You should see messages indicating that the server is running, including "Server running at http://localhost:3000" and "Database connected successfully".

### Step 2
Action: Since the feature involves making a POST request which cannot be directly tested through the browser, use a cURL command to simulate sending a POST request to the new API endpoint. Replace `GPT_STORE_PLATFORM_API_URL` and `API_KEY` in the command below with actual values before running it. Run the following cURL command in the terminal:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/reviews/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"modelId\":\"exampleModelId\"}"
```
Expected result: Since the actual GPT store platform's API URL and API key were not provided (and thus not integrated), you'll likely receive an error message indicating a failure to generate a review due to an error, such as "Failed to generate review due to an error". This shows that the route is correctly set up and attempting to process requests, but cannot complete the process without the correct integration details.

You are working on a App called "GPT-CRITIK" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "GPT-CRITIK":
```
### Application Specification for GPT Review and Comparison Web App

#### Overall Description and Goals
The application aims to provide real-time reviews, insights, and comparisons for custom GPT models available on the GPT store platform. It will facilitate users in making informed decisions by providing valuable data about each GPT model, including ratings, use cases, and user experiences. The app will also enable users to create profiles, submit their reviews, and interact with the community through discussions.

#### Features of the Application
1. **User Authentication**: Users must register and create a profile to access the app's features. The authentication system will support sign-up, login, and user profile management.
2. **Real-time GPT Reviews Generation**: Upon user request, the app will generate real-time reviews for GPT models, including a name, image (logo/favicon), 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data.
3. **GPT Comparison**: Users will be able to compare GPT models side by side based on their reviews, ratings, and use cases.
4. **User Reviews Submission**: Registered users can submit their reviews for GPT models.
5. **Community Discussion Platform**: A section for users to chat, share experiences, request feedback on custom GPT models, and receive feedback.

#### Functional Specification
1. **User Registration/Login**: A registration form for new users (username, password, email) and a login form for returning users. Passwords should be securely hashed.
2. **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit their profiles, including username, email, and password.
3. **Review Generation Page**: A search interface where users can request reviews for specific GPT models. The page will display generated reviews, including GPT model names, images, ratings, and detailed insights.
4. **Comparison Feature**: A comparison tool allowing users to select and compare multiple GPT models side by side.
5. **Submit Review Form**: A form for users to submit their reviews, including a rating and text description.
6. **Community Discussion Area**: A forum-like section for user discussions, feedback requests, and sharing experiences.

#### Technical Specification
- **Platform/Technologies**: Node.js with Express framework, MongoDB for database, Mongoose ORM for database management. React (or a similar JavaScript framework/library) for the frontend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and interaction.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Backend**: Express.js application handling API requests for user authentication, review generation, comparison data processing, and community interactions. MongoDB used for storing user data, reviews, and discussion content.
  - **Frontend**: React-based SPA (Single Page Application) for a dynamic user experience, including forms for registration/login, review submission, and a comparison tool interface. EJS could be used for server-side rendering of pages if React is not chosen.
  - **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with the GPT store platform's API to retrieve information and reviews on GPT models. Custom APIs for real-time review generation and data retrieval.

#### Integration Specification
- **GPT Store Platform API**: Integrate with the GPT store's API to fetch GPT model data, including names, images, and available insights. Precise authentication and data request methods should be based on the GPT store's API documentation.
- **User Authentication API**: For registering and authenticating users, possibly leveraging OAuth or JWT for secure session management.

### Constraints and Other Important Information
- **User Flow**: The app should ensure a smooth user flow from registration, through review generation, to comparison and community interaction, with minimal steps required to accomplish each task.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data and reviews are securely stored and managed, complying with privacy regulations.
- **Scalability**: While this is a prototype, the design should consider scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation feature.
Additional info/examples:
- Utilize possible React or something similar that works well with JavaScript for the frontend development.
- The real-time reviews generated should contain any other valuable and resourceful data that can be retrieved to help the users understand and determine the right pick for their use case.
- Users should also have a way for them to request for others to try a custom GPT that they have created and be able to receive feedback and so on.
```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement the GPT Model Review Generation feature. Create a new route in Express (e.g., /api/reviews/generate) that accepts POST requests. This route will call the GPT store platform's API to fetch the latest reviews for a specific GPT model based on the model ID provided in the request body. Use axios for making the API call. The response from the GPT store's API should be processed to include the GPT model's name, image, 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data before sending it back to the client. Ensure error handling for the API call and send appropriate responses for success and failure scenarios.

2. Develop the GPT Comparison feature. This involves creating a new route (e.g., /api/comparison) that supports POST requests, where users can submit two or more GPT model IDs for comparison. The backend will fetch data for each GPT model through the GPT store platform's API using axios, compare them based on ratings, reviews, and use cases, and return the comparison result to the client. Implement logic to handle cases where data for one or more models could not be retrieved and ensure the frontend receives a comprehensive comparison result or an error message.

3. Create a User Review Submission functionality. Add a new route (e.g., /api/reviews/submit) that handles POST requests for submitting user reviews. This route will require authentication, so integrate the existing authentication middleware to verify the user's session. The request body should include the GPT model ID, user rating, and text description. Store the review in MongoDB with a structure that links it to both the user and the GPT model. Implement input validation to ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted before saving the review.

4. Implement the Community Discussion Platform. Create a new MongoDB schema for discussion posts, including fields for the user ID (author), post content, timestamps, and replies (embedded documents or references to other documents). Develop routes for creating a new discussion post (/api/discussion/new), fetching all posts (/api/discussion), and replying to a post (/api/discussion/reply). Ensure that creating posts and replying require user authentication. Use Express to handle these routes, implementing appropriate request validation and error handling.

5. Set up the frontend using React. Initialize a new React application within the project structure if not already done. Create components for the main areas of the application: Login/Register, User Profile Management, GPT Review Generation, GPT Comparison, User Review Submission, and Community Discussion. Use React Router for handling navigation between these components. Ensure that the user's authentication state controls access to components that require login, redirecting to the Login component if necessary.

6. Integrate the frontend with the backend. Utilize axios in the React components to make API calls to the backend routes for user registration/login, profile management, review generation, comparison, review submission, and accessing the community discussion platform. Implement state management to handle the data received from the API responses and update the UI accordingly. Include loading states and error handling in the UI to provide feedback to the user during API interactions.

7. Finalize the application styling and interactions. Use CSS and potentially a UI framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI to style the React components, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across the application. Add interactivity where necessary, such as form validation feedback, buttons for submitting forms, and toggles for comparison selections. Ensure that the application provides a smooth user experience, with clear navigational cues for accessing the various features of the application.

A part of the app is already finished.
Here are files that were modified during this task implementation:
Files that were modified during implementation of the task are:
```
['/routes/apiRoutes.js', '/server.js']
```

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

4. **Comparison Feature**: A comparison tool allowing users to select and compare multiple GPT models side by side.
5. **Submit Review Form**: A form for users to submit their reviews, including a rating and text description.
6. **Community Discussion Area**: A forum-like section for user discussions, feedback requests, and sharing experiences.

#### Technical Specification
- **Platform/Technologies**: Node.js with Express framework, MongoDB for database, Mongoose ORM for database management. React (or a similar JavaScript framework/library) for the frontend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and interaction.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Backend**: Express.js application handling API requests for user authentication, review generation, comparison data processing, and community interactions. MongoDB used for storing user data, reviews, and discussion content.
  - **Frontend**: React-based SPA (Single Page Application) for a dynamic user experience, including forms for registration/login, review submission, and a comparison tool interface. EJS could be used for server-side rendering of pages if React is not chosen.
  - **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with the GPT store platform's API to retrieve information and reviews on GPT models. Custom APIs for real-time review generation and data retrieval.

#### Integration Specification
- **GPT Store Platform API**: Integrate with the GPT store's API to fetch GPT model data, including names, images, and available insights. Precise authentication and data request methods should be based on the GPT store's API documentation.
- **User Authentication API**: For registering and authenticating users, possibly leveraging OAuth or JWT for secure session management.

### Constraints and Other Important Information
- **User Flow**: The app should ensure a smooth user flow from registration, through review generation, to comparison and community interaction, with minimal steps required to accomplish each task.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data and reviews are securely stored and managed, complying with privacy regulations.
- **Scalability**: While this is a prototype, the design should consider scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation feature.
Additional info/examples:
- Utilize possible React or something similar that works well with JavaScript for the frontend development.
- The real-time reviews generated should contain any other valuable and resourceful data that can be retrieved to help the users understand and determine the right pick for their use case.
- Users should also have a way for them to request for others to try a custom GPT that they have created and be able to receive feedback and so on.

User was given instructions on how to test if the app is working correctly. Here are the instructions:
```
Can you check if the app works please? Here is a description of what should be working: 

[36m[1m### Step 1
Action: Start the server by running the command `npm start` in the terminal.
Expected result: You should see messages indicating that the server is running, including "Server running at http://localhost:3000" and "Database connected successfully".

### Step 2
Action: Since the feature involves making a POST request which cannot be directly tested through the browser, use a cURL command to simulate sending a POST request to the new API endpoint. Replace `GPT_STORE_PLATFORM_API_URL` and `API_KEY` in the command below with actual values before running it. Run the following cURL command in the terminal:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/reviews/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"modelId\":\"exampleModelId\"}"
```
Expected result: Since the actual GPT store platform's API URL and API key were not provided (and thus not integrated), you'll likely receive an error message indicating a failure to generate a review due to an error, such as "Failed to generate review due to an error". This shows that the route is correctly set up and attempting to process requests, but cannot complete the process without the correct integration details.[0m

User wrote this feedback:
```
this is the error I got in the terminal when i ran 'npm start'.:


PS D:\pythagora\gpt-pilot\workspace> npm start

Your job is to identify if feedback is good enough for you to solve the problem. If not, what information you need to solve the problem. Ask for any information that you need to solve the problem.
If you have enough information don't ask any questions.

When thinking of questions, consider the following:
- After getting answers to your questions, you must be able to solve the problem.
- Ask only crucial questions. Do not ask for information that you do not need to solve the problem.
- Ask least amount of questions to get the most information and to solve the problem.
- Ask only questions from the list provided bellow.
- Ask questions in same order as they are in the list.
- Never repeat same question.

Here is the list of questions you can ask:
"Can you please provide more information on what exactly you mean?"
"Can you please provide logs from the frontend?"
"Can you please provide logs from the backend?"
"What is the expected behavior?"
"What is the actual behavior?"
"On what page does the issue happen?"

You are working on a App called "GPT-CRITIK" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "GPT-CRITIK":
```
### Application Specification for GPT Review and Comparison Web App

#### Overall Description and Goals
The application aims to provide real-time reviews, insights, and comparisons for custom GPT models available on the GPT store platform. It will facilitate users in making informed decisions by providing valuable data about each GPT model, including ratings, use cases, and user experiences. The app will also enable users to create profiles, submit their reviews, and interact with the community through discussions.

#### Features of the Application
1. **User Authentication**: Users must register and create a profile to access the app's features. The authentication system will support sign-up, login, and user profile management.
2. **Real-time GPT Reviews Generation**: Upon user request, the app will generate real-time reviews for GPT models, including a name, image (logo/favicon), 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data.
3. **GPT Comparison**: Users will be able to compare GPT models side by side based on their reviews, ratings, and use cases.
4. **User Reviews Submission**: Registered users can submit their reviews for GPT models.
5. **Community Discussion Platform**: A section for users to chat, share experiences, request feedback on custom GPT models, and receive feedback.

#### Functional Specification
1. **User Registration/Login**: A registration form for new users (username, password, email) and a login form for returning users. Passwords should be securely hashed.
2. **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit their profiles, including username, email, and password.
3. **Review Generation Page**: A search interface where users can request reviews for specific GPT models. The page will display generated reviews, including GPT model names, images, ratings, and detailed insights.
4. **Comparison Feature**: A comparison tool allowing users to select and compare multiple GPT models side by side.
5. **Submit Review Form**: A form for users to submit their reviews, including a rating and text description.
6. **Community Discussion Area**: A forum-like section for user discussions, feedback requests, and sharing experiences.

#### Technical Specification
- **Platform/Technologies**: Node.js with Express framework, MongoDB for database, Mongoose ORM for database management. React (or a similar JavaScript framework/library) for the frontend, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and interaction.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Backend**: Express.js application handling API requests for user authentication, review generation, comparison data processing, and community interactions. MongoDB used for storing user data, reviews, and discussion content.
  - **Frontend**: React-based SPA (Single Page Application) for a dynamic user experience, including forms for registration/login, review submission, and a comparison tool interface. EJS could be used for server-side rendering of pages if React is not chosen.
  - **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with the GPT store platform's API to retrieve information and reviews on GPT models. Custom APIs for real-time review generation and data retrieval.

#### Integration Specification
- **GPT Store Platform API**: Integrate with the GPT store's API to fetch GPT model data, including names, images, and available insights. Precise authentication and data request methods should be based on the GPT store's API documentation.
- **User Authentication API**: For registering and authenticating users, possibly leveraging OAuth or JWT for secure session management.

### Constraints and Other Important Information
- **User Flow**: The app should ensure a smooth user flow from registration, through review generation, to comparison and community interaction, with minimal steps required to accomplish each task.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data and reviews are securely stored and managed, complying with privacy regulations.
- **Scalability**: While this is a prototype, the design should consider scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation feature.
Additional info/examples:
- Utilize possible React or something similar that works well with JavaScript for the frontend development.
- The real-time reviews generated should contain any other valuable and resourceful data that can be retrieved to help the users understand and determine the right pick for their use case.
- Users should also have a way for them to request for others to try a custom GPT that they have created and be able to receive feedback and so on.
```

Project architecture:
The GPT-CRITIK app utilizes a client-server architecture with React for the frontend to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience, and Node.js with Express for the backend to handle API requests, user authentication, and data processing. MongoDB, accessed through Mongoose, serves as the database to store user profiles, reviews, and discussion content. The app integrates with the GPT store platform's API for real-time data on GPT models. The architecture emphasizes scalability, especially for the community discussion platform and real-time review generation.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building the backend part of the app.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database to store user profiles, reviews, and discussions. Can be used via cloud services like MongoDB Atlas if preferred.
* express - Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and routing.
* mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
* react - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* bcrypt - A library to help you hash passwords.
* jsonwebtoken - Implementation of JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
* axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used for API calls.
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env.


Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement the GPT Model Review Generation feature. Create a new route in Express (e.g., /api/reviews/generate) that accepts POST requests. This route will call the GPT store platform's API to fetch the latest reviews for a specific GPT model based on the model ID provided in the request body. Use axios for making the API call. The response from the GPT store's API should be processed to include the GPT model's name, image, 1-5 star rating, use case description, and other valuable data before sending it back to the client. Ensure error handling for the API call and send appropriate responses for success and failure scenarios.

2. Develop the GPT Comparison feature. This involves creating a new route (e.g., /api/comparison) that supports POST requests, where users can submit two or more GPT model IDs for comparison. The backend will fetch data for each GPT model through the GPT store platform's API using axios, compare them based on ratings, reviews, and use cases, and return the comparison result to the client. Implement logic to handle cases where data for one or more models could not be retrieved and ensure the frontend receives a comprehensive comparison result or an error message.

3. Create a User Review Submission functionality. Add a new route (e.g., /api/reviews/submit) that handles POST requests for submitting user reviews. This route will require authentication, so integrate the existing authentication middleware to verify the user's session. The request body should include the GPT model ID, user rating, and text description. Store the review in MongoDB with a structure that links it to both the user and the GPT model. Implement input validation to ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted before saving the review.

4. Implement the Community Discussion Platform. Create a new MongoDB schema for discussion posts, including fields for the user ID (author), post content, timestamps, and replies (embedded documents or references to other documents). Develop routes for creating a new discussion post (/api/discussion/new), fetching all posts (/api/discussion), and replying to a post (/api/discussion/reply). Ensure that creating posts and replying require user authentication. Use Express to handle these routes, implementing appropriate request validation and error handling.

5. Set up the frontend using React. Initialize a new React application within the project structure if not already done. Create components for the main areas of the application: Login/Register, User Profile Management, GPT Review Generation, GPT Comparison, User Review Submission, and Community Discussion. Use React Router for handling navigation between these components. Ensure that the user's authentication state controls access to components that require login, redirecting to the Login component if necessary.

6. Integrate the frontend with the backend. Utilize axios in the React components to make API calls to the backend routes for user registration/login, profile management, review generation, comparison, review submission, and accessing the community discussion platform. Implement state management to handle the data received from the API responses and update the UI accordingly. Include loading states and error handling in the UI to provide feedback to the user during API interactions.

7. Finalize the application styling and interactions. Use CSS and potentially a UI framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI to style the React components, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across the application. Add interactivity where necessary, such as form validation feedback, buttons for submitting forms, and toggles for comparison selections. Ensure that the application provides a smooth user experience, with clear navigational cues for accessing the various features of the application.

Now, you have to debug this issue and comply with the additional user feedback.

**IMPORTANT**
Think about all information provided. Your job is to look at big picture by analysing all files to find where the issue is.
Don't reply with any code, your thoughts or breakdown of the issue. Respond only with description of solution, explaining what should be steps in solving the issue.
Create as little steps as possible to fix the issue. Each step should describe, using sentences and not code, what changes are needed in specific file or describe command that needs to be executed to continue working on the issue.
When there are multiple things that have to be done in one file write everything as one step and don't split it in multiple steps.
You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.

**IMPORTANT**
If report mentions *multiple* issues, treat it as if you got several separate reports: think through each, and provide solutions for each.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

The error message "npm: The term 'npm' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program." suggests that Node.js and npm are not installed on the user's system or not added to the system's PATH environment variable. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Direct the user to download and install Node.js from the official website, https://nodejs.org/. Installing Node.js will also install npm, as npm comes bundled with Node.js.
2. After installation, instruct the user to restart their terminal or command prompt. This is necessary to ensure that the system recognizes the newly installed Node.js and npm.
3. Ask the user to verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in their terminal or command prompt. These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively. If the versions are displayed, it confirms that Node.js and npm are correctly installed and accessible from the command line.

Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `The error message "npm: The` and ends with `accessible from the command line.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Windows machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.\n\nExamples:\n------------------------example_1---------------------------\n```\n{\n  "tasks": [\n    {\n      "type": "save_file",\n      "save_file": {\n        "name": "server.js",\n        "path": "/server.js",\n        "code_change_description": "",\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      "type": "command",\n      "command": {\n        "command": "ls",\n        "timeout": "5000",\n        "success_message": "README.md",\n        "command_id": "check_existence_of_readme_file"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"tasks": [{"type": "human_intervention", "human_intervention_description": "Download and install Node.js from the official website, https://nodejs.org/.
